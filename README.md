# REBalanced : Make flying feel real  

Rebalances Arma 3's planes to perform more like their real  
life counterparts.  

Recommended to use with AWESome as REBalanced's external  
fuel and afterburner system is based on AWESome's enhanced  
aerodynamics system.  

This addon is SP/MP and also works when only installed on  
client side.

addon for applications.

**Features**  

1. Aircraft Performance Configuration  

Aircraft performance config is modified to simulate how actual  
planes fly. This includes engine thrust, lift, drag, control  
performance, weight, fuel quantity and more. Especially, engine  
related performances are based on real-world engine data, so  
even within same aircraft those specifications may vary due to  
their specific variations or block versions.  
External fuel tanks are drained via AWESome Aerodynamics, so  
if you have AWESome Aerodynamics disabled, external fuels are  
unusable.  
&nbsp;

2. Afterburner System Overhaul  

Conventional afterburner system in FIR series is triggered via  
user action, but with REBalanced AB is automatically engaged  
when the throttle is at above 90%. AB also gives appropriate  
additional thrust and will consume more fuel. These AB thrust  
and fuel consumptions are based on real-world engine data.  
&nbsp;

3. HUD Modification  

HUD now shows units in knots and feet, with vertical speed in  
feet per minute. REBalanced also fixes HUD related bugs including  
inverted speed bar, Mach number error when over Mach 1, and other  
display related issues.  
&nbsp;

4. Unit Info Panel Modification  

Modified unit info panel includes AB / hook position indicator  
and colored fuel bar for external fuel tank level. This enables  
the pilots to confirm the hook position prior to touchdown without  
going to 3rd person view, and know how much external fuel they  
have.
